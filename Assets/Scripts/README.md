Setting Up the Scene
1. Create a floor: Add a plane or any other appropriate GameObject to act as the floor for the simulation. This is where the creatures and food will spawn.

2. Add walls (optional, but recommended): To prevent the creatures from falling off the map, create walls around the floor.

3. Create prefabs for creatures and food: You will need to create prefabs for both the creatures and the food. The provided scripts will handle the instantiation and behavior of these prefabs in the simulation.

Usage
1. Attach the provided scripts to the appropriate GameObjects or create new empty GameObjects and add the scripts to them.

2. Configure the script settings in the Unity Inspector, such as spawn points, population size, and food quantity.

3. Press the Play button in Unity to start the simulation.
